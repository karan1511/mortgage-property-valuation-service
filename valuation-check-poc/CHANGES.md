# Changes Made for Local Development

## Summary

The application has been simplified for local development without AWS S3. It now reads PDFs directly from the local file system.

## Key Changes

### 1. AWS S3 Configuration Commented Out

**File:** `src/main/java/com/mortgage/valuation/config/AwsConfig.java`
- All AWS S3 configuration code is commented out
- Placeholder class added to prevent compilation errors
- To use AWS S3 in the future, uncomment this file

### 2. S3Service Modified for Local File System

**File:** `src/main/java/com/mortgage/valuation/service/S3Service.java`
- Changed from downloading from S3 to reading from local file system
- Reads from path: `localstack-data/s3/mortgage-valuation-documents/lnap4879/{requestId}/report.pdf`
- No AWS dependencies required

### 3. Application Configuration Updated

**File:** `src/main/resources/application.yml`
- AWS S3 configuration commented out
- No AWS keys or credentials needed

### 4. Documentation Updated

**Files:** `README.md`, `QUICK_START.md`
- Removed LocalStack setup instructions
- Simplified to just create directory and copy PDF
- Updated workflow documentation

## How to Use

1. **Create directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p localstack-data/s3/mortgage-valuation-documents/lnap4879/rt74321
   ```

2. **Copy your PDF:**
   ```bash
   cp your-valuation-report.pdf localstack-data/s3/mortgage-valuation-documents/lnap4879/rt74321/report.pdf
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

4. **Test the API:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/valuation/process \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"requestId": "rt74321"}'
   ```

## Benefits

- ✅ No AWS credentials required
- ✅ No LocalStack/Docker setup needed for PDF storage
- ✅ Simpler local development workflow
- ✅ Easy to test with your own PDF files

## To Re-enable AWS S3

1. Uncomment the code in `AwsConfig.java`
2. Update `application.yml` to include AWS S3 configuration
3. Update `S3Service.java` to use S3 client instead of file system
4. Provide AWS credentials in environment variables
